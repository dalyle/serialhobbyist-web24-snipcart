#### Does Astro Snipcart force me to use a particular theme or style?

No. Astro Snipcart is designed to be used with any theme or style. Nothing visual is rendered except for the content you slot into them! It is a set of components that [simply render conditional attributes on an element in order to work with Snipcart](/en/motivation). Snipcart adds it's own logic.

#### If I use the Astro Snipcart Design System does it force me to use a particular structure or layout?

No. While the design system comes with layout and page layout components these are optional. It's highly recommended to try them out though to see if they work for you.

#### Some components in the Astro Snipcart Design System have client side logic. How?

This is currently implemented with [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/).

#### How can users see their past orders?

Provided you've turned it on, Snipcart can handle this for you. Use the `CustomerSignIn` component - clicking it will allow a user to register or sign in. Account details are stored and handled by Snipcart, you don't need to do anything.

#### Snipcart supports products and subscriptions. Does Astro Snipcart surface this functionality?

Astro Snipcart provides product support with subscription support on the way. The fundamental building blocks for this already exist in the repository.

#### Is this unit tested?

Partial unit testing is implemented with Vitest in a separate branch. Coverage will be increased soon.

#### How do I handle shipping, variable shipping costs depending on weight, refuneds, taxes, e-mailing orders, receiving money, webhooks, etc?

All of this is handled by Snipcart. Have a browse through [the documentation](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/dashboard/store-management). Also, Astro Snipcart supports specifying product dimensions and weight (metric).

#### I have a backend I'd like to integrate with, for example, to receive order event notifications. How do I do that?

Snipcart provides both a REST API and a Webhook system. Have a browse of [the documentation](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/webhooks/introduction).
