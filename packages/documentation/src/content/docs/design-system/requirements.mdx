description: Requirements for Astro Snipcart's design system
---

Before using the design system there are some requirements.

* Tailwind is used to implement the styling for the design system.
    Therefore, Tailwind is a requirement. Read [Astro integration documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/).
* Configure Tailwind to search for design tokens in the `node_modules` directory for the design system.
    This process is documented in the [Getting Started](/getting=started) page.
* The Inter font was used when designing the UI. Ensure you have loaded the Inter font - Inter is a popular and free and open source font family.
    While the design system **will function correctly without this**, the UI will not look visually correct.
